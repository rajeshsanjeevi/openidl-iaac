# terraform backend setup 
This code can be cloned to an environment where terraform CLI is available/possible to initially setup terraform backend resources, i.e., S3 bucket for managing terraform state files and DynamoDB for handling state file locking and a S3 bucket to manage terraform input files

##Requirements:
   
    -------------------------------------- 
    | Sno |     Resource       | Version |
    |-----|--------------------|---------|
    | 1.  | Terraform version: | > 1.0.0 |
    | 2.  | AWS provider:      | >= 3.0  | 
    --------------------------------------
**Note: Prepare aws environment with necessary iam user and iam role that would be assumed.** 

1. Setup terraform CLI, https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
2. Get this code to the system
3. Refer to terraform.tfvars.template and create an input file 
4. Perform terraform initialization using #terraform init
5. Run terraform plan to review the actions terraform will perform #terraform plan --var-file=inputfile.tfvars
6. Run terraform apply to configure terraform backed resources like S3 bucket and dynamodb table using #terraform apply --var-file=inputfile.tfvars   
7. Store the state file generated by above action in secure place for future management of these resources. Example: store in AWS s3
